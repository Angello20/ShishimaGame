# Shishima Game in Racket

## Overview

This project is a simulation of the traditional African game Shishima, implemented in Racket. The game is similar to tic-tac-toe but with a different board structure. My implementation uses a 3x3 grid instead of the traditional board.

## Gameplay

### Objective

The objective of Shishima is to align three of your pieces in a continuous line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

### Rules

1. **Placement Phase**: Players take turns to place their three pieces on any of the empty intersections.
2. **Movement Phase**: Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent empty spots.
3. **Winning**: The first player to align their three pieces in a row wins the game.
